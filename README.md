# plasmaOS
## plasmaOS is available to download from: dl.albiebh.uk/plasmaOS
plasmaOS has been created from a debian base. I have added and removed packages, am using KDE Plasma as my GUI.
ISOs will be available soon, for now, you can create boot files yourself, chroot into the system, or wait for the ISOs.
